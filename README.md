# Objective

In this project, we learnt about the basics of retrofit, glide and firebase and used them to build an app that help users to find housing. By connecting our app to a server, we are able to save data remotely and it allows all users to get access to the same data. Retrofit makes it easier for network calls. And with the firebase, users can only post a housing if they are logged in. If users are not logged in, the app will automatically direct them to login page and they can log in with their google acount. The intents used in this project also allows users to email the owner if they are interested in getting more information about the housing. 

# Demo
